## floodit-allegro

Simple flood it using pure C and allegro library

## Why?

Actually, this was an assignment on my BIT degree, but it was much simpler. As I had already worked with allegro before (though not with pure C, only C++), I decided to go beyond. Hopefully, I'll finish it before the day I have to turn it in. Hopefully.

## Installation

Well, I don't reeeally expect anyone to actually care about this, but if for some weird reason you do, so far I think the only thing you have to do is install allegro.

I used cmake but I'll organize it later. If your distro (or windows) don't use /usr/include for include files and /usr/lib for libraries, you'll have to change the dirs on CMakeFiles.txt. 

Hopefully I'll get the chance to do those things right before the end of the project.

PS: I recommend an out-of-tree build, and/or something like `mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..`

Made a matrix with colors and a simple structure to add colors and some structs to encapsulate everything.
